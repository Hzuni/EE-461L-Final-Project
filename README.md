# EE-461L-Final-Project
The motivation behind our SmartClicker project came from our past experiences with similar systems in college, and a desire to reduce the cost and provide a more convenient way to participate in and create in class quizzes. There is a commonly used iClicker system at the University of Texas at Austin, and this system, while effective, is expensive and inconvenient. To fully understand our motivations, it is necessary to look into the flaws of the current system. The iClicker currently used cost upwards of $50 to purchase for students, and teachers must purchase a hosting device. These extra pieces of hardware add an unnecessary cost to users, especially college students. The second major flaw is the inconvenience of having to bring a the voting device to class Yes, we realize that it is not the most difficult thing in the world to bring a remote device to class, but on days where you forget the device, you are left with no options. There is no backup way to participate in the quizzes and this can oftentimes leave a student, who was present and knew the answers, in a position to receive a zero for those grades. We are striving to find a better option than the expensive and inconvenient iClicker system, and so the SmartClicker idea became our project.
